# Object Relations Code Challenge

## Your Task

For this challenge, you have been given the job of creating a command line interface for your local drive-in movie theater, Happy's Sunset Drive-In! You have been asked to create a tracking tool that allows employees to know how many cars are at each movie screen.  The drive-in has many screens, and each screen can have many cars.  For the safety of all viewers, there is a limit to the number of cars that can be at a movie screen.  

## Notes

Your goal is to build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables and connect the required classes to a command line interface.

Do your best to follow Ruby best practices. For example, use higher-level array methods such as `map`, `select`, and `find` when appropriate in place of `each`

We've provided you with a tools/console.rb file, so you will be able to test out the methods that you write here.

**To Submit** - once you've completed all the deliverables, please copy/paste your three class definitions into the `solution.rb` file. Please don't submit the lab until we give you the signal.

## Deliverables

Implement all of the methods described below:

### DriveIn

+ DriveIn#screens
  + returns all movie screens
+ DriveIn#cars
  + this method should return all cars currently at all screens
+ DriveIn#full_house?
  + returns true if all movie screens are at capacity
+ DriveIn#whats_playing
  + returns the names of all movies currently playing

### MovieScreen
#MovieScreen.new is provided for you in this lab, and takes in a movie title as a String and a capacity as an Integer

+ MovieScreen#cars
  + Returns an array of all cars currently at _this_ movie screen
+ MovieScreen#at_capacity?
  + Returns a boolean.  The return will be true if the number of cars at _this_ movie screen is at capacity
+ MovieScreen#add_car
  + Adds an instance of a car to _this_ movie screen if the movie screen is not at capacity, creates a new car instance and returns the string "Enjoy!".  If the movie screen is at capacity, return a string that says 'Movie is sold out'
+ MovieScreen.all_screens
  + Returns all movie screens

### Car
